          Purchases that are to be delivered within the territory of any of the

          When placing the order, the customer can freely choose to pay for
          purchases made by card or cash on delivery (only in Spain and some
          countries of the European Union) or other similar means. In certain
          cases and to prevent possible fraud, the Seller reserves the right to
          request a specific payment method from a customer in the event that
          the buyer's identity is not reliably proven. The website uses
          information security techniques generally accepted in the industry,
          such as firewalls, access control procedures and cryptographic
          mechanisms, all with the aim of preventing unauthorized access to
          data. To achieve these ends, The user/client accepts that the provider
          obtains data for the purposes of the corresponding authentication of
          access controls. Any contracting process or process that involves the
          introduction of personal data (health, ideology, etc.) will always be
          transmitted using a secure communication protocol (HTTPS://) in such a
          way that no third party has access to the information transmitted
          electronically.

          The customer will be able to select the shipping method from among
          those possible for their shipping area. You should bear in mind that
          delivery times, quality of service, delivery point and cost will be
          different for each form of transport.

            The Seller sends orders to its clients through different express
            transport companies of recognized national and international
            prestige. The delivery date at the customer's home depends on the
            availability of the chosen product and the shipping area. The
            indicative transport times are available in the “Shipping Costs”
            section of our website. Before confirming your order, the customer
            will be informed of the shipping costs and transportation times,
            both indicative, that apply to your specific order. However, both
            may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each order.
            Especially:
            <li className="pl-5">
              Transport times may be altered by extraordinary incidents with the
              carrier and by difficulties in the delivery of the merchandise.

            <li className="pl-5">
              The shipping costs that appear on the website when placing the
              order are indicative and are calculated based on an average
              statistical weight of grs. The Seller reserves the right to alter
              shipping costs when the requested weight varies by more/less 10%
              with respect to the average weight mentioned. In the event of a
              price variation, the Seller will notify the client of the
              variation by email and the client may choose to cancel their order
              without any costs being charged.

          Buyer's rights and return policy
        </p>
        <p>
          The Seller does not guarantee its customers the availability or
          delivery time of the products offered on its website except for
          products in which a certain guarantee is expressly cited. The catalog
          shown is merely indicative since manufacturers or distributors do not
          communicate stock in advance or guarantee delivery times. This
          situation prevents the Seller from being able to accurately inform its
          customers about the availability of the products as well as
          guaranteeing a specific delivery time which, in any case, will depend
          on the time it takes for the manufacturer or distributor to supply the
          product.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Seller guarantees its customers the possibility of canceling their
          order at any time and without any cost as long as the cancellation is
          communicated before the order has been made available to the carrier
          for shipment.
          <br />
          <br />
          The customer will have a period of fourteen days from receipt of the
          order to terminate the contract and return the purchased product. The
          client will communicate to the Seller within the stipulated period and
          by any means permitted by law, his desire to exercise the right to
          terminate the contract. The returned order must be delivered together
          with the delivery note and, if applicable, invoice issued to the
          Seller, with the Buyer bearing the return costs.
          <br />
          <br />
          The customer may return any item purchased from The Seller as long as
          the products have not been opened or used and retain their original
          seal or packaging. In these cases, The Seller will return the purchase
          money through a credit to the credit card, through a bank transfer to
          the account indicated by the client or through a credit to his or her
          personal account. If a product other than the one requested by the
          customer is delivered by mistake on the part of the Seller, it will be
          withdrawn and the correct product will be delivered without any
          additional charge to the buyer.
